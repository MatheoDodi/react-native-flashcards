# Flashcards

iOS / Android App made with React Native.

My take on the classic Flashcards concept. User should be able to :

* Select one of the available decks and start a quiz with the questions included
* Add a question to a deck
* Add a new deck

Project was bootstrapped with create-react-native-app.

## Let Me See It

To get started using the app:

* install and download Xcode
* git clone or download the repo on your local machine
* open the terminal and navigate to the location of the repo
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start with `npm start`
